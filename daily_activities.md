# Daily Development Activities

This file tracks detailed daily development activities with realistic patterns.

## Activity Patterns (STREAK MAINTAINING)
- **Minimal Activity Days** (30%): Quick streak maintenance, 1 commit
- **Light Activity Days** (40%): Casual development work, 2 commits  
- **Medium Activity Days** (25%): Regular development work, 3 commits
- **High Activity Days** (5%): Intensive development, 5 commits

**ðŸ”¥ 100% STREAK MAINTENANCE** - No gaps, but realistic variety in activity levels!

## Contribution Methods
- **Direct Push** (~60%): Direct commits to main branch (especially minimal days)
- **Pull Requests** (~40%): Feature branches with PR workflow

## Timing Variety
- Multiple workflows run at different times throughout the day
- Commits can happen at 06:00, 10:30, 14:45, 18:20, or 22:55 UTC
- Creates natural variation in commit timing
