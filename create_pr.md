# Pull Request: Implement Realistic Contribution Patterns

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements a realistic contribution pattern system that creates inconsistent, human-like activity instead of flat daily commits.

## 🔄 What This Creates

### Activity Patterns (Realistic Human Behavior)
- **40% No Activity Days** - Realistic gaps (weekends, busy periods, breaks)
- **35% Low Activity Days** - Light work, quick fixes, 1 commit
- **20% Medium Activity Days** - Regular development, 3 commits  
- **5% High Activity Days** - Productive sprints, 5 commits

### Contribution Methods (Mixed Approach)
- **60% Direct Push** - Commits pushed directly to main branch
- **40% Pull Requests** - Feature branches with PR workflow

### Special Patterns
- **Monday Blues** - Higher chance of no activity on Mondays
- **Friday Energy** - More likely to be active on Fridays
- **Weekend Inactivity** - Higher chance of gaps on weekends
- **Month-end Crunch** - Increased activity at month end
- **Catch-up Commits** - Batch commits for 2-5 days of work (realistic!)

## 🛠️ Implementation

### New Workflows
1. **Daily PR Workflow** (`.github/workflows/daily-pr.yml`)
   - Runs daily at 00:30 UTC
   - Decides activity level using pseudo-random patterns
   - Creates realistic gaps in contributions
   - Chooses between direct push or PR creation

2. **Catch-up Commits** (`.github/workflows/catchup-commits.yml`)
   - Runs Mon/Wed/Fri at 02:15 UTC
   - 30% chance of creating 2-5 days of backdated commits
   - Simulates realistic batch work scenarios

### New Files
- `daily_activities.md` - Detailed activity tracking
- `test_realistic_patterns.sh` - Local simulation script

## 📊 Expected Results

The contribution graph will show:
- Natural gaps and inconsistencies
- Varying intensity levels
- Mix of single commits and burst periods
- Realistic human-like patterns instead of perfect daily consistency

## 🧪 Testing

Run `./test_realistic_patterns.sh` to see a 30-day simulation of the patterns.

Example output shows ~60% active days, 40% gaps - much more realistic than 100% daily activity!
